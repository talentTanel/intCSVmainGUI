1. database not working anymore with acceleration, need to also have it inserted into database
2. Pressing open new file and then not choosing anything clears all previous values (FIXED?)
3. If injection point is set and we plot away from it then it forces itself onto graph
4. If a custom point is put on graph before injection then the legend hide doesn't work correctly
